# Analog Function Generator 

This repo contains all project files of analog function generator that can generate a Sine, Sawtooth, Square (with adjustable duty cycle), and a triangular waveform. These waveforms can be generated with adjustable amplitude, frequency, and DC offset. The Vpp can vary from 2V to 12V, and the frequency can be changed from 20Hz to 20kHz. The whole circuit was generated using only the analog electronics components like Op-Amps, transistors, resistors, and capacitors.
